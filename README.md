# Stegnography
## Introduction :
With the increasing need for secure communication, traditional encryption methods are often insufficient to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. Steganography provides an additional layer of security by hiding confidential data within digital media, such as images, audio, or video, making the presence of hidden information undetectable. This project aims to develop a secure data hiding mechanism using image-based steganography.

## Problem Definition :
Sensitive information is at risk of interception during transmission over networks. While encryption can protect the content, it does not conceal the existence of the message, making it a target for cryptanalysis. The challenge is to securely embed and extract secret messages within digital images without raising suspicion while ensuring robustness against image modifications (such as compression or resizing).
